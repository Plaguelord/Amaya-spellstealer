## Amaya's SpellStealer Addon

---

#### _Description_
This is the public repo of [Amaya's SpellStealer Addon](https://google.com)

This addon was created using as inspiration other like [Mage nuggets](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/mage-nuggets) and 
[SpellStealer](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/spellstealer).\

[Amaya's SpellStealer Addon](https://google.com) creates a couple of frames, prioritizing spells on your current target 
(by _strata_ or _user config_), ordered by _remaining time_ (showing its cooldown on top of spell icon).

#### _Internal script_

If you want to benefit from the simple _.bat_ script that copy [Amaya's SpellStealer Addon](https://google.com) to WoW's
addon folder, you'll need to create a system variable called **_WOW_ADDONS_HOME_** pointing to your WoW's addons folder.
